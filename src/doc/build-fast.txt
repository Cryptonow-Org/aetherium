Fast rebuilds with cmake (on example of linux, similar is for windows)

*** ONCE ***
In project top directory, execute:

mkdir build && cd build &&  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D BOOST_IGNORE_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON -D BUILD_CONN_TOOL=OFF -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -D BUILD_SIMPLE_MINER=OFF -D BUILD_SIMPLE_WALLET=OFF -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF -D ENABLE_COTIRE=ON -D COTIRE_MINIMUM_NUMBER_OF_TARGET_SOURCES=1 -D COTIRE_VERBOSE=ON ..

You are now in (project-name)/build/

*** REBUILD ***
Now each time to re-build the project, while in build/ just do:
  make 
or
  make -j 4 

And run ./src/bitmonerod

On windows this is the same, except for other mkdir commnad (just create directory build and run the cmake from inside it!)

*** FAQ ***

If sometihng fails, you must be in the new build/ directory that you created and call  ccmake ..  or ccmake .. with more options.
